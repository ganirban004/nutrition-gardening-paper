# Public Perceptions of Nutrition Gardening: An Integrated Approach to Climate Change, Malnutrition and Mental Health
This study aims to assess public awareness and perceived benefits of nutrition gardening, along with the support needed to adopt such practices. An online survey conducted among urban residents of Kolkata, primarily students and their families, yielded 95 responses, of which 93 valid entries were retained for analysis. The respondents were selected using a judgment sampling approach, focusing mainly on students and their families. Logistic regression was employed as the primary analytical method to explore factors influencing individuals’ willingness to engage in nutrition gardening, revealing noteworthy demographic patterns within the population. The study revealed that more than 87% favored rooftop or terrace nutrition gardens, though about 40% cited lack of time and 77% highlighted the need for equipments, knowledge and financial support. Findings indicate strong public interest in nutrition gardening as a way to address climate change, improve nutrition and enhance women’s health. Based on these results, a schematic idea of conducting a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design is proposed as a potential framework for future research to develop and evaluate a more practical implementation strategy in future. Based on the study, community-based initiatives, such as rooftop gardening kits, seed banks, school programs and knowledge exchange with rural farmers, can enhance adoption, while policymakers and NGOs can design supportive urban agriculture and nutrition policies.
