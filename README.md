# Exploring Public Perceptions of Nutrition Gardening as a Strategy for Addressing Climate Change, Malnutrition, and Mental Health
This study assessed public awareness and perceived benefits of nutrition gardening, along with the support needed to adopt such practices. An online survey among urban residents, mainly students and their families, yielded 95 responses. Logistic regression analysis showed that about 90\% favored rooftop or terrace nutrition gardens, though 70\% cited lack of time and 60\% highlighted the need for incentives, knowledge, and equipment. Findings indicate strong public interest in nutrition gardening as a way to address climate change, improve nutrition, and enhance womenâ€™s health.Based on these results, a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design is proposed to develop and evaluate a more practical implementation strategy.
